                <b>Private Eye: </b><br>
                I opened a detective agency and would receive clients as Diana and then use my Amazonian powers to solve the cases. What I didn't anticipate was mobsters piecing together the connection between Diana Prince and Wonder Woman.

                <b>Secret Agent:</b><br/>
When I killed Maxwell Lord, it sparked controvery and I was forced into hiding but refused to stay out of the action. While Donna Troy took up her mantle, as Diana Prince, I joined the Department of Metahuman Affairs as a secret agent with Nemesis as my partner.

                <br/>
                The thought of Wonder Woman as a secretary contrasts with her role as an empowering female icon. And yet, she's been a secretary twice as Diana Prince and Wonder Woman. The first time was during WWII, where she served as secretary to Colonel Philip Darnell to stay close to Steve Trevor.</figcaption>
