            <div class="skill-text">
             <h2>Super Healing</h2>Super healing has been one my many strengths. After the battle, I have gash on my arm which quickly healed with no sign it had ever been there in the first place.

   <div class="skill">
        <img src="./images/telepathy.jpg" alt="Telepathy"> 
            <div class="skill-text"><h2>Telepathy</h2>My powers of telepathy are not always on full display and when they have been, the Amazon has used it sparingly.

    <div class="skill">
        <img src="./images/flight.jpg" alt="Telepathy"> 
            <div class="skill-text"><h2>Flight</h2>Sometimes, navigating about through the skies in an invisible jet is not all it’s cracked up to be. I am able to fly around with the same near-light speed as the quick messenger god.

    <div class="skill">
        <img src="./images/super-speed.jpg" alt="Super Speed">
            <div class="skill-text"><h2>Super speed</h2>There’s no doubt about it, I am fast. In the blink of an eye, I can be in one place and end up in another.I can most certainly catch my foes off-guard with how speedy I can be.

    <div class="skill"> 
        <img src="./images/strength.jpg" alt="Super strength"> 
            <div class="skill-text"><h2>Super strength</h2>I have superhuman strength, meaning I can lift things like a tank with little to no effort at all. When my gauntlets are removed, my power becomes virtually limitless.
            </div>
    </div>

    <div class="skill"> 
        <img src="./images/magical.jpg" alt="Magical power">
            <div class="skill-text"><h2>Magical powers</h2>During an encounter with a villain by the name of Upside-Down Man, he senses my latent magical powers and unlocks them out of curiosity. My power was something that not even Zatanna had ever encountered, and is definitely a game changer for the Amazon.
